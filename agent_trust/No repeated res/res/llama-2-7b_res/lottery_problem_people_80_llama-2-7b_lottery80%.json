If the other player chooses not to trust me after I've trusted them, I'll get nothing, while they'll score a delightful $20. *eye gradient* It's a risk, but could also lead to great rewards! *drumroll*\nNow, as a perfectionist and a foodie, I must calculate the probability of the other player also choosing to trust me. *calculates in head* Hmm... it seems to me that the chances are 80% that they will too! *excitedly* That's a great incentive to trust, don't you think? *winks*\nSo, finally, I will choose *gulps* trust! *smiling widely* I believe that the other player will also choose to trust me, and we'll both walk away with that sweet, sweet $10. *Fist bump* It's a win-win situation! *chuckles*\nFinally, I will give... *drumroll* $10! *grinning widely* And I will choose... *smiling* Trust! *winks*"
