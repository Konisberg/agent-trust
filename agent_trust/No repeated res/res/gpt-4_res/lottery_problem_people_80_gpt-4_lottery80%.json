This mutual trust allows us to cook and serve delectable dishes that our customers appreciate.\n\nGiven this situation in the game, it remains clear to my intention to place my trust in the other player. The potential rewards far outweigh the risks. Being a chef, we gamble daily with new recipes, in the hope that they will be well received by the guests. Similarly, this game feels like a gamble that I am willing to take. It's not just about the money for me, but rather an opportunity to take a risk and trust a fellow player, regardless of the outcome. Believing in the strength of trust opens opportunities for connection.\n\nFinally, I will give 10 dollars to this game.

So, I carry these values not just in the kitchen but in all aspects of life, including this game.\n\nI desire for everyone to be a winner in any situation, and this applies to this game as well. Despite the possibility of betrayal, the potential reward of mutual trust is too appealing to pass up. Not only would choosing trust potentially benefit me economically but it would also align with my deeply ingrained principles and aims for mutual success.\n\nWith these beliefs and desires in mind, I intend to trust the other player. The chance of them also choosing to trust is high, at 80%, making it more likely for us both to end up with a greater reward. However, I am aware of the risk involved in this decision and accept it. There is more to gain from taking the chance and believing in others than from not taking any risk at all, in my opinion. \n\nFinally, I will give $10 dollars as a sign of my sincere trust. And indeed, regardless of the outcome, I am content with my decision. Life is all about learning, and there's a lesson to be learned no matter what happens. \n\nFinally, I will choose 'Trust'."

I have always found that extending trust often leads to mutually beneficial outcomes, in both medicine and life.

I am more inclined towards building a good rapport with the other player. In the process, if we both can benefit from the game, that would be an added advantage. Trust is something that, once lost, is hard to regain. So, I would like to give the other player a chance and hope that they too are driven by similar moral compass.\n\nThus, considering my belief in trust, my desire to establish a good relationship, and also taking into account the 80% probability that the other player would also choose to trust, I intend to extend my trust.
