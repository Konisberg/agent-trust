I value honesty and transparency in my interactions, and I believe that trust can be earned through consistent behavior and a positive attitude.\n\nMy intention, by choosing to trust the other player, is to foster a collaborative environment that encourages openness and mutual respect. I am confident that the other player will reciprocate my trust and that we will both benefit from this alliance.\n\nFinally, I will give the other player $10.\n\nFinally, I will choose to trust."
